This is the official repository for the browser-game Blobs.io
You may not find the game under that domain as we haven't bought it yet and it is still a WIP.

What is this needed for?
You need this collection of source files to host blobs.io as I find C++ more suitable for calculations than JavaScript.

Note: Version 1.0.0 and higher will require you to link the optparse library, which can be found at https://github.com/y21/optparse
If you are on linux, you can use the deps.sh file to download the library:
$ chmod 777 deps.sh
$ ./deps.sh

========================
Set-up and example usage
========================
